Can you make the values that are clickable show the hand cursor like it does for the grayed out array items and booleans?

And can you make each item show the finger cursor, but when you click into it (like for an itneger or string) it changes to a normal mouse pointer when hovering over that field?

And can you make each item in the array to where when I move my selection to the left/right using the arrow keys it selects the whole next object (excluding the quotes) and if I click tab while a value is selected (for either booleans or array items) it toggles the item that is selected?

Can you also make the intellisense list for the folders/files show over all other elements? Right now it gets cutoff by the bottom of the input box

Also, when clicking the up/down arrow keys while in the input field, can you make it select the param in the next field as if the user clicked into that value? that way the user can seamlessly navigate between each field.

Also, right now when I click on a grayed out item in the array, it tries to select the whole array rather than just the item I'm clicking on.

Also, can you make it to where the auto-select range thing doesn't select the quotes? It should only select the content. If the content within the quotes is empty, it should just select the empty position in the middle of the quotes.

Also for the types of values that you can click on with the finger cursor it shouldn't actually select the entire range of that whenever you click on it it should just toggle it but not try to highlight the value itself.

And can you make it to where when I click on a value, while that value is selected, if I click the right arrow key or left arrow key it moves the mouse position to the left/right of that object without forcing it to select the entire object? That way I can still have fine-grain control over the precise position of the mouse cursor if I don't want to select an entire object
